# SimpleCalculator
This is a simple calculator which takes in two numbers and performs either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. This is performed by using a GUI, which represents a standard calculator. As a user enters their desired numbers for each input, the input's value is displayed and updates in real time. When the user presses enter, the desired computation is performed and the calculation is shown in place of this text. Above the computation's display, the previous inputs are displayed to show the user the full expression they inputted, and these numbers' values update in real-time respective to which value (first or second) the user is on.

Need to add the ability to handle a decimal place as an input and add the necessary checks so only one can be inserted into the values.

I would like to eventually add the ability to store an infinite number of inputs and allow the use of parantheses.
